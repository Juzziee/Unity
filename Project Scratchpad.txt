Ideas for game implemention:

Multiple classes:
 - Warrior 	| Big swings, av damage, high health, slow
 - Rogue 	| Short stabs, av damage (Maybe directional?), av health, fast
 - Wizard	| Range attacks, av damage, low health, av movement
 - Druid	| Short range attacks, low damage, low health, high movement - More of a support class.

Each class may have 3 abilities.

----------------------

Classes:

- Warrior
	Base: Top cleave attack that does average damage (currently same as swing)
	Special ideas: Ground slam explosion, Javelin throw, defensive stance, charge forward(Similar to dash but immune)

- Rogue
	Base: Shorter range stab attack doing av damage at double speed.
	Special ideas: Blink forward, temp invisiblity, poison grenade, sprint, Slash (A nuke sort of skill)

- Wizard
	Base: Range base attack, high damage slow attack speed.
	Special ideas: Frost nova, Magma ground, damage aura, lightning mines,

Level Layout
 - Outside levels | More hill like terrain, lower level monsters
 - Dungeon enterence | Slightly more powerful mobs, Perhaps more of a flatter map
